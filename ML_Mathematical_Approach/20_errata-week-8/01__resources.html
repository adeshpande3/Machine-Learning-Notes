  Video Lecture Errata
 </h1>
 <p hasmath="true">
  In the video ‘Motivation II: Visualization’, around 2:45, prof. Ng says $$ℝ^2$$, but writes ℝ. The latter is incorrect and should be $$ℝ^2$$.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  In the video ‘Motivation II: Visualization’, the quiz at 5:00 has a typo where the reduced data set should be go up to $$z^{(n)}$$ rather than $$z^{(m)}$$.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  In the video "Principal Component Analysis Algorithm", around 1:00 the slide should read "Replace each $$x_j^{(i)}$$ with $$x_j^{(i)}-\mu_j$$." (The second x is missing the superscript (i).)
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video "Principal Component Analysis Algorithm", the formula shown at around 5:00 incorrectly shows summation from 1 to n. The correct summation (shown later in the video) is from 1 to m. In the matrix U shown at around 9:00 incorrectly shows superscript of last column-vector "u" as m, the correct superscript is n.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video "Reconstruction from Compressed Representation", the quiz refers to a formula which is defined in the next video, "Choosing the Number of Principal Components"
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video "Choosing the number of principal components" at 8:45, the summation in the denominator should be from 1 to n (not 1 to m).
 </p>
 <p>
  In the in-video quiz in "Data Compression" at 9:47 the correct answer contains k≤n but it should be k&lt;n.

  Programming Exercise Errata
 </h1>
 <p>
  In the ex7.pdf file, Section 2.2 says “You task is to complete the code” but it should be “You
  <strong>
   r
  </strong>
  task”
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ex7.pdf file, Section 2.4.1 should say that each column (not row) vector of U represents a principal component.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ex7.pdf file, Section 2.4.2 there is a typo: “predict the identit
  <strong>
   f
  </strong>
  y of the person” (the 'f' is unneeded).
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ex7_pca.m file at line 126, the fprintf string says '(this mght take a minute or two ...)'. The 'mght' should be 'might'.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the ex7 projectData.m file, update the Instructions to read:
 </p>
 <pre>%    projection_k = x' * U(:, k);
</pre>
 <p>
  In the function script "pca.m", the 3rd line should read "[U, S] = pca(X)" not "[U, S, X] = pca(X)"
 </p>
