  XV. Anomaly Detection
 </h1>
 <p>
  At the risk of being pedantic, it should be noted that p(x) is not a probability but rather the normalized probability density as parameterized by the feature vector, x; therefore, ϵ is a threshold condition on the probability density. Determination of the actual probability would require integration of this density over the appropriate extent of phase space.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the
  <strong>
   Developing and Evaluating an Anomaly Detection System
  </strong>
  video an alternative way for some people to split the data is to use the same data for the cv and test sets, therefore the number of anomalous engines (y = 1) in each set would be
  <em>
   20
  </em>
  rather than 10 as it states on the slide.

  XVI. Recommender Systems
 </h1>
 <p>
  In review questions, question 5 in option starting "Recall that the cost function for the content-based recommendation system is" the right side of the formula should be divided by m where m is number of movies. That would mean that the formula will no longer be standard cost function for the content-based recommendation system. However without this change correct answer is marked as incorrect and vice-versa. This description is not very clear but being more specific would mean breaking the honour code.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  In the Problem Formulation video the review question states that the no. of movies is $$n_m = 1$$. The correct value for $$n_m=  2$$.
 </p>
 <p>
  In "Collaborative Filtering" video, review question 2: "Which of the following is a correct gradient descent update rule for i ≠ 0?"; Instead of i ≠ 0 it should be k≠0.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  In lesson 5 "Vectorization: Low Rank Matrix Factorization" and in lesson 6 "Implementation detail: Mean normalization" the matrix Y contains a mistake. The element $$Y^{(5,4)}$$ (Dave's opinion on "Sword vs Karate") should be a question mark but is incorrectly given as 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  In lesson 6 this mistake is propagated to the calculation of μ. When μ is calculated the 5th movie is given an average rating of 1.25 because (0+0+5+0)/4=1.25, but it should be (0+0+5)/3=1.67. This the affects the new values in the matrix Y.
 </p>
 <p>
  In ex8_cofi.m at line 199, where theta is trained using fmincg() for the movie ratings, the use of "Y" in the function call should be "Ynorm". Y is normalized in line 181, creating Ynorm, but then it is never used. The video lecture "Implementation Detail: Mean Normalization" at 5:34 makes it pretty clear that the normalized Y matrix should be used for calculating theta.
 </p>
 <p>
  In ex8.pdf section 2, "collaborative fitlering" should be "collaborative fi
  <strong>
   lt
  </strong>
  ering"
 </p>
 <p>
  In ex8.pdf section 2.2.1, “it will later by called” should be “it will later b
  <strong>
   e
  </strong>
  called”
 </p>
 <p>
  In checkCostFunction.m it prints "If your backpropagation implementation is correct...", but in this exercise there is no backpropagation.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the quiz, question 4 has an invalid phrase: "Even if
  <strong>
   you
  </strong>
  each user has rated only a small fraction of all of your products (so r(i,j)=0 for the vast majority of (i,j) pairs), you can still build a recommender system by using collaborative filtering." The word "you" seems misplaced, "your" or none.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the quiz, question 4, one of answer options has a typo "For collaborative filtering, it is possible to use one of the advanced optimization algo
  <strong>
   ir
  </strong>
  thms"
 </p>
 <p>
  In ex8.pdf at the bottom of page 8, the text says that the number of features used by ex8_cofi.m is 100. Actually the number of features is 10, not 100.
